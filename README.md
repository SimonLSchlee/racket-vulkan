Vulkan API integration and utilities for Racket.

## Supporting the project

I actively maintain my open source projects, and
wish to do so full-time. If you want to support unique
software and get guarenteed response times for support, consider

## TODO

- [x] Generate Racket FFI bindings against the Vulkan 1.1 API specification.
- [ ] Include RAII-equivalent resource management to reduce verbosity
- [x] Write a test application that generates an image and writes it to the file system
- [ ] Write a test application that uses a GUI and swap chain to present graphics.
- [x] Write example applications to aid education
