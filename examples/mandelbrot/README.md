This is a Racket port of @Erkaman's `vulkan_minimal_compute` example, minus
the `lodepng` PNG encoder. TO use everything in this project, you will need
ImageMagick's `convert` command and the Vulkan SDK installed on your system.

Once ready, just execute `run.sh` to render the Mandelbrot set to a PNG.
